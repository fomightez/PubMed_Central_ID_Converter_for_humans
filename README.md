**PubMed_Central_ID_Converter_for_humans**  
A simple library for using the PubMed Central ID Convert API.  
Key features:
- **It is JupyterLite compatible**.
- **Control if you get results in a Python dictonary, Pandas dataframe, or JSON text.**

It is largely Python-related kernel agnostic, which means you can use it in JupyterLite as well as in more standard Jupyter where a typical ipykernel is involved.
