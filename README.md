### PubMed_Central_ID_Converter_for_humans: PubMed API use for humans

A simple library for using the PubMed Central ID Convert API in the mdodern Python/Jupyter ecosystems.  
Key features:
- **Control if you get results in a Python dictonary, Pandas dataframe, or JSON text**.
- **It is JupyterLite compatible**.


It is largely Python-related kernel agnostic, which means you can use it in JupyterLite as well as in more standard Jupyter where a typical ipykernel is involved.
